<p class="small-heading">How to make representations</p>

<p>If there are exceptional circumstances you want us to consider before we proceed with enforcement action, you must write to us by [[${cs_review_period_end_date}]]. This is called a representation.</p>

<p>To make a representation, go to <span class="emphasis">[URL-to-be-confirmed]</span></p>

<p>If we accept your representation, we will pause enforcement action for a limited period so you can file the statements. The <span th:if="${is_llp == 'yes'}">LLP and its members</span><span th:if="${is_llp == 'no'}">company and its directors</span> will remain in default and we’ll resume enforcement if you do not successfully file the statements.</p>
