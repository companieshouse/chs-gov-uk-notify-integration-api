<hr/>

<p class="subject-line">Why PSCs need to verify</p>

<p>This new legal requirement is a result of the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act.
    All company directors and PSCs must verify their identity to prove they are who <br/>they say they are.
    This has been introduced to help prevent people using companies for illegal purposes.</p>
