This folder contains the letter templates as they were before we started organising them by letter id. 

They are kept here so to be able to regenerate old letters. Do not add a new template here. New versions should go to the [letters](/src/main/resources/assets/letters) folder. Make sure the app (ie chips) sends the new `letter_id` property for any new templates
